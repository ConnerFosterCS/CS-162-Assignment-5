Assignment Completed On 06-04-2019

Assignment Description: "For this assignment, you will implement a linked list class using pointers and object-oriented programming. Although the C++ STL (Standard Template Library) offers a linked list implementation, you must implement this program "from scratch" and cannot simply utilize the existing STL offerings (<list> or <forward_list>).
Your linked list will be designed to contain signed integers of type int." (from assignment)
